----------------Types---------------- 
**  int :
    size : 4 bytes 
    value : 32-bit signed integer
**  unsigned int :
    size : 4 bytes
    value : 32-bit unsigned integer => the same size of integer with no bit reserved for sign

**  The integer types :
    char - signed char (8bit )
    short int - unsigned short int (16 bits)
    int - unsigned int (32 bit)
    long int - unsigned long int (64 bit)
    long long int - unsigned long long int (128bit or 64bit) 

**  The floating point types :
    float 
    double 
    long double 

**  Boolean type 
    bool (C++ only -- C++98)
    values : true or false 

    _Bool (C only --C99)
    Header : <stdbool.h>
    Alias : bool
    values : true or false 

**  Arrays 

**  Structures and Classes 
    c++ classes are based on the c structures 

**  Union 
    a union is a set of overlapping object types 

**  pointers 
    a pointer is a reference to an object of a giving type 

**  C++ Reference type 
    very much like a pointer but with different semantics 
    references are immutable,the major difference is that, once they are defined they cannot be change to refer to a different object 
 
**  qualifiers 
    2 types :
    -storage class : static / register / extern
    -type qualifiers : const / volatile / mutable 

    NB :the auto is deprecated (removed)
    
**  enumeration 
    works more like constants than like types 

**  Union 
    data structure that allows you to use the same memory space for different types
