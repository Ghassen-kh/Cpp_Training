**  object : is an instance of the class ==> instanciate to describe the process of creating 
an object

**  members ; are the content of an object 
    there are 2 elements : data members (properties) and function members (methods)

**  constructor : is called when an object is created 

**  destructor : is called when the object is destroyed 

=> the C++ class is based on the C struct, in a struct members default public access, but in a
 class members default private access 

**  accessor methods for data members you want access to : function members  designed to set 
values in and get values from the data members ==> getters and setters 

****** In classes you can do : ******
- variety of constructors
- overload or disallow default constructors
- allocate and deallocate memory 
- overload operators 
- function operator
- conversion operator


**  constructors and destructors are special member functions 
    - there several types of constructors in c++ and one type of destructor 
    - when you don't provide a constructor and destructor, implecitely provides a default constructor
    - which is a constructor that takes no arguments 
    - there is also a copy constructor provided and a copy operator provided and a destructor provided

NB: search for overloading constructors : rule of three 
NB: search for size_t type 

**  overload :
    there are 2 distinct ways to overload operators in c++:
    - one with member functions as part of a class definition 
    - the other is seperate non member functions 

**  member access specifiers : in class inheritance
