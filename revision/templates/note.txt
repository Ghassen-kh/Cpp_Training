**  Templates 
    - the feature that supports generic programming ==> programming in terms of algorithms independant 
    of types ==> generic programming refers to code that works independant of type
    - the compiler must generate specializations for every instanciation of a template 
    - c++ supports both template functions and template classes 
    - equivalent to macros in c
